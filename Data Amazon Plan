For the data, I would like to show how many packages get delivered over certain areas, or perhaps even just worldwide. 
Here are my facts: 

Amazon Logistics processed 11,147 U.S. delivery orders per minute in 2023 (equivalent to 186 orders per second).
27.3% of all packages shipped in the U.S. went through Amazon Logistics in 2023.
Amazon’s U.S. package volume increased 15.7% from 2022 to 2023.
From 2021 to 2022, Amazon Logistics’ package volume grew 6.25%.
From 2018 to 2023, package volumes increased at a 49.1% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).
